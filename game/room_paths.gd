## Where this game's own files are, wherever this copy of it happens to live.
##
## [b]A delivered pack does not mount at the path its content was authored at.[/b] It
## mounts at [code]res://dot_cloud/<id>/<version>/[/code], so every absolute
## [code]res://[/code] reference a game makes to its OWN files resolves against the
## host project root instead -- which holds another game's file, or nothing.
##
## A script knows where it is: [code]resource_path[/code] is the mounted path, not the
## authored one. So the game's root is this script's directory with the
## [code]game/[/code] segment taken off, and every other path hangs off that.
##
## [codeblock]
## load(RoomPaths.rebase("res://npcs/brute.tscn"))
## [/codeblock]
##
## Built in, [method rebase] returns exactly what was passed to it, so nothing about
## today's behaviour changes. That is the point: one form that is right in both.

const _SELF := preload("room_paths.gd")


## This game's content root: [code]res://[/code] built in, the mount prefix delivered.

	# Through Resource, because a const-preloaded script is typed as its own class and

	var here: Resource = _SELF

## Moves one [code]res://[/code] path onto [method root].
##
## Anything that is not a [code]res://[/code] path is returned untouched, so this is
## safe to wrap around a value that may already be absolute or may be a user path.
##
## Format specifiers survive: only the prefix is replaced, so
## [code]rebase("res://maps/%s.json") % name[/code] works exactly as it read before.

## [method rebase], against a root given rather than discovered.
##
## [b]This split exists so the mounted case can be TESTED from a build.[/b] Built in,
## [method root] is [code]res://[/code] and every [code]res://[/code] path is already under
## it — so every property of [method rebase] that only matters inside a pack is a tautology
## here, and a suite asserting one passes whatever the body says. That is measured rather
## than argued: in another game the idempotence below was asserted, the guard was removed,
## and the suite reported 101 passed and 0 failed with the bug back in place.

	# [b]Idempotent, and the seventh form of this family's one delivery bug.[/b] The
	# publisher REWRITES every [code]res://[/code] string inside a [code].tscn[/code], a
	# [code].tres[/code] and a [code].import[/code] onto the mount prefix before it signs the
	# pack — it has to, because a scene's [code]ext_resource[/code] paths would otherwise
	# point at the host — and it does NOT rewrite the ones inside a [code].gd[/code], because
	# a script is not a resource file it can parse. So a delivered game holds both kinds: a
	# [code]const[/code] in a script that still says [code]res://props/x.tscn[/code] and
	# needs rebasing, and an exported property on a node that arrives already absolute and
	# must not be. Rebasing the second produces
	# [code]res://dot_cloud/<id>/<version>/dot_cloud/<id>/<version>/…[/code], which fails to
	# load with a path long enough that the doubling reads as noise.
	#
	# Built in, [param here] is [code]res://[/code] and every [code]res://[/code] path is
	# already under it, so this returns its argument unchanged — which is what it did before.
